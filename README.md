## Virtual Retro Console

Have you ever looked at the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console and was disappointed with the $15 price tag? The Micro-16 project seeks to provide a free and open source PICO-8 like console for enjoying game development.

## Project Scope
The finished project should consist of a text editor, sprite editor/packer, sfx/music editor, compiler, assembler, [Buffer of Bytes 3000 memory](src/bob3000/), [Better Than Pico 6000 CPU](src/btp6000/), [Pixel Graphics Unit 7000](src/pgu7000/), and the [MicroDisplay 16 SDL3 library](src/MiDi16/).

## Help is needed!
